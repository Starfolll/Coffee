      <h1>Latte</h1>
      <p>
        A<u>latte</u>is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.
        The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffè latte,
        which means "milk coffee".
        The word is also sometimes spelled latté or lattè in English
        with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a
        deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography.

      <p>
        Caffè Americano or Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by
        diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to,
        but different flavor from traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an
        Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added.
